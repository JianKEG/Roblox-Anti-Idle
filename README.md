# Roblox Anti-Idle
- Anti AFK for ROBLOX
- Can be used as AutoClicker

# [!IMPORTANT]
Potential Windows Defender/AntiVirus False Positive! My project is safe and does not contain any malicious code.

# How it works?
Since ROBLOX does not register inputs if its unfocused. This program helps you to continue whatever you are doing while AFK Farming or grinding in the background!  
  
The program's logic is the following:    
- focuses the roblox client
- sends the input
- unfocuses roblox client  

# How to start?
Install AutoHotKey (AHK) from their [website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).  
Head to [releases](https://github.com/JianKEG/Roblox-Anti-Idle/releases) to download the exe file.  
Once downloaded, it's all pretty self-explanatory.   
**Make sure Roblox Client is not in fullscreen!**  
# Keybinds
**F1** - to start the script  
**F2** - to stop the script  
**F4** - to capture the cursor position (once you clicked "Capture Position")  
**Esc** - to close the script (Script will not close unless pressed)
